    "I often have a Jupyter notebook open, and I want to switch back-and-forth between a web browser running a Jupyter Notebook, and a web browser for looking up something on the internet (*e.g.* Stack Overflow).  When you're using the *same* web browser for bother of these you can't easily `alt-tab` between them, unless you set up a custom shortcut for intra-program tabbing.  \n",

    "My solution for this was inspired by Chris Albon, who mentioned that he uses *two different browsers*: one for Jupyter and one for everything else.  I figured out how to this and forgot, but I remember it being easy.  When I remember I'll link to it here."
